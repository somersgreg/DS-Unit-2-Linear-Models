If dont have Vs Code installed then skip to "chocolatey install".

To start Jupyter in vscode terminal (Ctrl + Shift + ~) type: 
>	`jupyter notebook`	-> If Jupyter opens in browser you're all set.	-> Doesnt work? Check if have Pip.

Check if have Pip: 
>	`pip --version`	-> Yes? Install Jupyter (next step).	-> No? Check for Python (below next).

Install Jupyter, in preferably elevated powershell, type: 
>	`pip install jupyter`	-> Refresh Environment (see below) and then run Jupyter Notebook. Reboot may be required.

Check for Python:
>	'Python --version'	-> Yes? Install Pip.	-> No? Install Chocolatey.

Install Pip: 
>	`python -m pip install -U pip`

REFRESH ENVIRONMENT
After all installs you must: 
>	`refreshenv`

CHOCOLATEY INSTALL:
In elevated PowerShell, ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not Restricted.
>	`Get-ExecutionPolicy`

If it returns Restricted, then run...
>	`Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned`
 or...
>	`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`
 then/or...
>	`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`
Wait a few seconds for the command to complete.

If you don't see any errors, type `choco` or `choco -?` to check if working.

INSTALL PYTHON:
This will install current (non-beta) version by default.  Dont forget to "Refresh Environment" (above) after each feature install.
>	`choco install python` (--pre option recommended but I dont know what it means.)

Now you can...
Install Pip
>	`python -m pip install -U pip`
...Then refresh and install Jupyter:
>	`pip --version`
>	`pip install jupyter`
> 	`pip install pipenv`
Remember this must be in elevated powershell or other cmd. 

Now install what else you need:

Install Git + Bash
>	`choco install git.install`
> 	`git config --global user.name [any username]`
>	`git config --global user.email [your github email]`
>	`git config --global core.autocrlf true`
This is to bother you every time you commit but you can turn off warnings.
> 	`git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`
This is if you're too good for vim

Install VS Code
>	`choco install vscode.install`
	Be SURE to set default terminal profile to GitBash!
Install Pandas
>	`pip install pandas`
Install MathPlotLib
>	`pip install matplotlib`
Install Seaborn
>	`pip install seaborn`
